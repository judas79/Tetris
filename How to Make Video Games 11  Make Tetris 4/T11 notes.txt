Only 2 videos remain until we finish Tetris! In this video we will focus on deleting full rows. 
We will search each column in each row to find those full of cubes. Then we’ll delete them in the array as well as in the scene. 
Then we have to bring all blocks above down and then increase the score on the screen.

Like always all the code is available under the video below. Do with it what ever you’d like.

I noticed, that MyArray was not showing the last five, to the bottom, rows in the grid view, of my game.
To fix this, I selected MyArray and set the Scale for the x / y positions .5 less than they where set at.
Now all 20 rows appear in the X N, grid, all the way to the very bottom.

In this tutorial 11, we will cycle through the rows, in our gameplay grid, and also the columns, and delete the ones that have been filled,
with the shapes, move the next rows down, as we add to our score, for the game

We will start, in the GameBoard.cs, so continue with our notes there...

After returning from adding our GameBoard.cs after creating; DeleteAllFullRows(), IsRowFull(), and DeleteGBRow functions.
We will resume coding, in our Shape.cs, where we can test the functions, we jus created, in a place where the shapes are moving downwards, 
Where the 's' key is used to go downwards, seems good, so continue there...

Returning from Shape.cs, after adding the call for DeleteAllFullRows(), we will next go into Unity,
and run the game, to see if it works as expected.
Partial success:  the bottom row was deleted, and the next row became the bottom, but the row above that one, did not.

We will continue, inside Shape.cs, at the TODO, where we will add the score; continue there...

After returning from Shape.cs after creating IncreaseTextUIScore() to increase the score, lets test it;
run the game in Unity...

It works!
