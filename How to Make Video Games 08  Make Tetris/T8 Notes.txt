In this video I start making one of the greatest games ever being Tetris! I’m trying something new this time. 
In previous videos I tested ideas before videoing them. This time I will create Tetris with no previous preparation. 
I’ll test my way through creating the whole game.

I think this will benefit people because they’ll see me make mistakes and then see how I go about solving problems. 
In this first video I show how to draw everything in Gimp. I then setup the game, create the borders, the interface and then all the tetrominos. 
I hope you enjoy this series and learn a lot.

********************************** create cube.png *******************************

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrkPokBIvEA&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSYnwKyw9xP5tEn7GSUWwZJ&index=8

Create the cube,for Tetris in Gimp, or get it from the link, above.  Make the Cube 20 x 20 pixels.
Save cube as .png.
The playing grid is 10 cells by 20, we will make it 12 by 20 to copernsate for the outer box of it overlapping.


********************************* set up game ***************************
Remember to Save Scene, every so often, and name the Scene in the Scene folder, MainScene.
Make the Tetris folder to create the unity game in, the choose the folder and create the 2d Unity game; Create Project.  Drag those downloaded images and souds, 
inside the Tetris Assests zip file or folder if expanded, into the top Tetris folder, for the game.
Inside Unity, under Assets creat these folders:
Sounds
Scenes
Prefabs
Scripts
Sprites

Drag Cube.png into Sprites folder
Drag all sound clip files into Sounds folder

Set Main Camera Up:
Background = choose Black in color wheel popup
Size = 20 (for now)

********************** Make Walls *************************

In Hierarchy create, Create Empty, rename to HorzWall.
In Hierarchy create, Create Empty, rename to VertWall.

Drag Cube from Sprites folder into Hierarchy, HorzWall.
Inside HorzWall, dulpicate Cube, 11 times, for a  total of 12 cubes.
The first cube in HorzWall should have its x and y position set to 0.

Select  cube in sprites folder and adjust the settings:
pixels per unit = 20;   which is the same as our cube size, when it was created in Gimp.
Filter Mode = Point
click apply.

Next click cube(1) in our Hierarchy and change the Position x = 1.
Then cube(2) Position x =2;  
Go up x: 1++ for each position to cube(11); for all of them
You should now have a horizontal wall made of cubes, in Scene window.
Collapse the HorrizWall then select it, and drag it into the Prefabs folder.
Delete HorrizWall from the Hierarchy list.

Drag Cube from Sprites folder into Hierarchy, HorzWall.
Inside VertWall, dulpicate Cube, 19 times, for a  total of 20 cubes.
The first cube in VertWall should have its x and y position set to 0.

Next click cube(1) in our Hierarchy and change the Position y = 1.
Then cube(2) Position y =2;  
Go up y: 1++ for each position to cube(19); for all of them
You should now have a vertical wall made of cubes, in Scene window.
Collapse the VertWall then select it, and drag it into the Prefabs folder.
Delete VertWall from the Hierarchy list.

Next, drag in 2 VertWall from your prefab folder into the Hierarchy list.
Rename one LeftWall and the other RightWall.

Next, drag in 2 HorzWall from your prefab folder into the Hierarchy list
Rename one TopWall and the other BottomWall.

Next, click the main acamera and adjust the size from 20 to 12, it was to big.

Next, line up your left and right walls on the inside of the camera area, aligned evenly, in a horizontal plain.
The Two side walls go inside of the borders of the top and bottom walls

  topwall
____________
|          | <- RightWall inside the edge, of the TopWall
|          |

Select all four walls, in inspector, and center your rectangle.
Use the camera image in the scene window, as a reference point, to center your rectangle around.
After all walls are aligned, you should have a seemless rectangle.

********************* create Interface ************************

Next we will create our interface.
First you can collapse, all the walls down, to make things easier to see.
Next from the hierarch create, UI, choose text.
This will create Canvas, with Text, inside it.
Rename Text to NextLabel, and in its setting: Text = NEXT

Mext select Canvas in Hierarchy, and change settings:
Render Mode = World Space
Dynamic Pixel Mode = 10
Position x and y = 0
Width = 55
Height = 25

Get the Canvas width and height to, just be on the outside of the rectangle, of the main camera, 
by messing with the numbers.

Next drag the NextLabel, to the top left of our wall rectangles, but not touching the LeftWall.
Using Scale, in our NextLabel settings, is the best way to get the clearest text, when getting the proper size, for the label.
Using the larger font sizes, to scale, creates a more blurry image.
NextLabel settings:
Font Type = Bold
Font size = 10
Color = White
Scale x and y = 0.15
width = 55
heigth = 25

Make a duplicate of the NextLabel and name it ScoreLabel.
Change ScoreLabel Text setting to Score.
Drag the ScoreLabel to right side of the playing field(the rectangle).
Click the Alignment 'center' button, to center the ScoreLabel.
Font size = 10

Next, make sure the position of the y axis for Scorelabel, is equal to, NextLabel position y axis.
Then duplicate ScoreLabel and name it Score.
Settings:
Score Text = 0
Drag Score down straight below the scorelabel.

**************************** Tetris Shapes ***********************************

Next we will work on the Tetris Shapes, Thes are the colors and corresponding shapes:
IShape = Blue 4 ----
JShape = light blue 4 ___
                        |
LShape = Mustard 4  ____
                    |
OShape = Yellow 4 --
                  --
SShape = florecent green 4   --
                            --
TShape = dark pink 4 ---
                      |
ZShape = red 4 --
                --

First drag a cube from the Sprites folder into the Scene window
Set its Positions for x and y to 0
in Hierarchy, create Empty, 
Setting for Create Empty now named GameOject; positions y and x = 0
then drag the cube in it, from the Hierarchy list.
Rename GameObject to OShape.
Make 3 duplicates, for a total number of 4 of them.
Drag them into an OShape:
cube: x = 0 y = 0
cube(1) x = 0  y = 1
cube(2) x = 1  y = 1
cube(3) x = 1  y = 0

Notice the cubes only change by 1 value, to make the OShape, and the other shapes will have much in common.
Next, select all 4 cubes that make up the OShape and set the Color to Yellow.

collapse the cubes in OShape and drag OShape into Prefabs.
Then delete OShapes from our hierarchy list area.

Next, use this same type of method, to create all the other shapes listed above, one at a time.
Try to make them centered (balanced left and right), as much as possible, without using fractions
